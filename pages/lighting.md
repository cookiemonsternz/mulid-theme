# A Lighting Controller
## Pretext
---
Its time for my late night, music fueled braindump of information! 
<i style="font-size: 8px;">nz gets sleep token releases a day early :)</i>

In this episode, I'll be examining the concept, feasibility, and potential design of a custom lighting console.

## On Lighting
For me, lighting is a way to visually convey the emotions that music evokes. It provides satisfaction to not only the ears, but the eyes. 

I think in a way, it could almost be contrasted with *Book* -> *TV Show*, any show could technically be a book, but the visual aspect allows us to more deeply connect with the story.

In lighting, I see the same, not only does it give more impact to the music (and the music always tells a story in itself), but it also *shines a light* on the performers. 

Slightly unrelated note, but having a character to connect with for music, also can aid the emotional impact / delivery of the piece, and this is another aspect of not only why lighting is good, but also why live performances are as popular as they are; Seeing the person who so deeply tears themselves open for your entertainment do it live in front of you is an almost ritual experience.

Overall, I think great lighting (in this order):
- Enchances the story of the music
- Highlights the performers
- Adds impact to the music (aka looks cool)

## A brief history of lighting

In the beginning, live performance with lighting was exclusive to theatre, and over time has progressed through various stages, leading up until today.

### The Candle Era

Way back in the mid 1500's, lighting mainly consisted of either natural lighting (used in happier scenes / performances), or a mix of candles, crude oil lamps, torches, and cressets (hanging lamps). 

Obviously, lighting was not considered a massively dynamic element, with only general illumination being common (e.g, even wash of the whole stage).

Changes in lighting throughout performances did happen however, the basic concept of coloured lights was detailed by Sebastiano Serlio in his treatise on architecture.

The system allowed for very little remote control, stagehands would walk around cutting wicks to turn off lights, a far cry from the modern ease of digital control systems.

Another interesting thing to note:
Lights were mainly positioned in both chandeliers over the stage and house, as footlights (sat on the front edge of the stage), or in 'ladders' in the side wings.

### The Gaslight Era

Skipping over oil lamps, gas lighting was one of the most interesting stage lighting systems in my opinion.

The first gas stage lighting system was installed in 1816 in the *Chestnut Stree Theatre* in Philidelphia (Or maybe the Olympic Theatre, my research was not very deep). This initial system was again only adjustable at the lights, with the control board making its appearance several years later in 1840.

The gas table was the first form of control which somewhat resembles modern lighting desks. It consisted of a series of valves which controlled the flow of gas to lamps remotely.

Many different types of gas lights were developed, including footlights, winglights, borderlights, groundrows, lengths, standards and bunch lights.
This extensive list of lights enabled lighting from many new angles. 

Note that limelights were also regularly used at this time.

Colors were similarly achieved via a medium placed in front of the lamp, over a wireguard a distance from the naked flame.

Limelights were another invetion during this period, whereby hydrogen and oxygen were utilized to heat a block of limescale to incandescence. These produced a incredibly intense white light, which was then focussed via a reflector, and later, also a lens.

### The Incandescent Era

In 1878, Joseph Wilson Swan patented the worlds first incandescent lamp. This was a revolutionary invention outside the theatre industry, and it wasn't until 1881 that incandescent lights were extensively used in theatre. The first theatre to use incandescent lighting was the Savoy Theatre in London, which used 824 16 candle lamps to light the stage and an additional 334 to light the auditorium.
Richard D'Oyly Carte, the theatre manager, stated -

- *"The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres. As everyone knows, each gas-burner consumes as much oxygen as many people, and causes great heat beside. The incandescent lamps consume no oxygen, and cause no perceptible heat."*

Brothers catalogue. Note the eight set of border lights above. the four sets of wing lights on the sides of the stage,
the seven bunch lights mostly up stage, the switch board in the basement and the electrician standing in the "prompter's box."

Alright, I'm tired of writing history for now, more coming later!

## The Console

There is a **massive** selection of lighting consoles in the modern day, ranging from simple dmx controllers -

To complicated beasts like the GrandMA3 -

Honestly, the range is incredible, but there are a few **significant** problems:
1. The price -
Every semi-professional hardware on the market will run you at least $4,000 (2,393 USD). This is simply unfeasible for hobbyists, and the basic controllers are too 'dumb' for any mildly inspiring light shows.
2. The software - 
Fortunately, most consoles software have free versions which can run on a computer, but out of all softwares I've tried, they all have the same few problems for me.
